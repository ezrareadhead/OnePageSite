# Assignment Notes

To begin this assignment, I modelled a low fidelity prototype of my website using Figma. This allowed me to get a general understanding for the desired content and layout within it. My aim was to develop a stand alone website that told the historic and current events surrounding the Canberra Air Disaster, and its memorial. I wanted this to be engaging and interactive, following a linear narrative like this website (https://plus.u-aid.org) which I had come across in my initial research phase for industry standards.

Unbeknownst to me, using a website as a form of storytelling proved to be very difficult. I had envisioned portraying this through elements which animated as they entered the viewport. However, this required heavy use of JavaScript, which is possible, but elements got tangled and confused when I tried to execute this. As shown by my JS code for showing and image when hovering over the red text, I was easily able to do this for the first element (Lockheed Hudson Bomber) however it did not work when applied to the second (Keren Rowland); no matter how much troubleshooting I did, I was not able to find a solution. This was still left in my code to demonstrate the attempt, despite it not working. Another issue with this section of code, is that the image perfectly aligns with my mouse on the laptop I used to write it, but when tested on other screen sizes, the alignment is thrown off by a significant amount.

To aid the narrative of this assignment, I had used a lot of assets including images, videos, gifs, and 3D elements. Initially, I had no issues with this, but towards the end the html code would lag to the point where it became unusable. This was mostly prevalent within parallax elements such as the forest landscape. After some research, I ruled this down to messy code and assets which were too large; hence slowing my page down. In tidying up my code somewhat and compressing each file within my assets folder, this has issue been solved and transitions now ran smoothly on scroll. A minor issue which also effects the the parallax elements, is when a mouse is used instead of a trackpad as the scroll is not as smooth and the animation becomes less obvious. I have put this down to the particular mouse I was using during my testing so this may not be a major issue but I must be mindful that in professional circumstances this would be something worth considering.
