        <p>At first, they didn’t think anything of it.</p>
        <p>The lights were still on, and they had a torch in the back of the car, so they went to see if they could work out what had happened.<br>
        <p>It was quiet at first, then all of a sudden it sounded like a few girls screaming and crying in the distance.<br>
        At this point, they all freaked out and jumped back in the car, desperately trying to start it.</p>

        <p>This went on for about 10 minutes.</p>

        <p>Casie and her friends have never been back since.</p>
